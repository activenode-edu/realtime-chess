# JavaScript Realtime Chess Game

_made by David Lorenz / @activenode_.

This is a YouTube Step-by-Step project made and published in parts.
For each part there is a branch, check the content on YouTube: https://youtube.com/@activenode.

## Tech Stack

The board game logic itself is in its own file and independent from any stack - just **JavaScript**.

Out of convenience for rendering logic and easy database and WebSocket usage I use:

- Next.js
- Supabase

## How to use

Jump to the branch named `partN` where N is the part e.g. for Part 1 it is `part1` and run `npm i && npm run dev`.
